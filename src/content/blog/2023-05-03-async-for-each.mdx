Let's say you have an array, and you need to run a promise on each of its element synchronously, like this

```javascript
// index.js

const apiList = [
  "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/",
  "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/2/",
  "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/3/",
  "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/4/",
  "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/5/",
];

apiList.forEach(endpoint => {
  console.log(`Get pokemon from ${endpoint}`);
  fetch(endpoint)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => console.log(`Pokemon: ${data.name} with id: ${data.id}`));
});

console.log("Script finished...");
```

When you run that script, you get this output

```
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/2/
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/3/
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/4/
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/5/
Script finished...
Pokemon: ivysaur with id: 2
Pokemon: bulbasaur with id: 1
Pokemon: charmeleon with id: 5
Pokemon: venusaur with id: 3
Pokemon: charmander with id: 4
```

Notice that, we run the promise, in this case `fetch` asynchronously. even tho we modify the script to use `async` `await` like code below, it doesn't matter it will give the same result

```js
// index.js

apiList.forEach(async endpoint => {
  console.log(`Get pokemon from ${endpoint}...`);
  await fetch(endpoint)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => console.log(`Pokemon: ${data.name} with id: ${data.id}`));
});
```

Still get the same output right??, now how to run it synchronously??.

## Run It Synchronously

Instead using `Array.forEach` we can use `for` loop like this

```js
// index.js

(async () => {
  for (let index = 0; index < apiList.length; index++) {
    console.log(`Get pokemon from ${apiList[index]}...`);
    await fetch(apiList[index])
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => console.log(`Pokemon: ${data.name} with id: ${data.id}`));
  }
  console.log("Finished");
})();
```

> this code is the trick to run async await in **top level** javascript file.
>
> ```js
> (async () => {
>   // your async await code
> })();
> ```

you get output like this, which means it run synchronously or sequential one by one.

```
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/...
Pokemon sync: bulbasaur with id: 1
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/2/...
Pokemon sync: ivysaur with id: 2
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/3/...
Pokemon sync: venusaur with id: 3
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/4/...
Pokemon sync: charmander with id: 4
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/5/...
Pokemon sync: charmeleon with id: 5
Finished
```

But that script is ugly af! ðŸ˜‰

## The Better Code

Oke, let's make it better by creating a function and callback like this

```js
const asyncForEach = async (array, callback) => {
  for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
    await callback(array[index], index, array);
  }
};
```

Now your script gonna look like this

```js
(async () => {
  await asyncForEach(apiList, async endpoint => {
    console.log(`Get pokemon from ${endpoint}...`);
    await fetch(endpoint)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => console.log(`Pokemon: ${data.name} with id: ${data.id}`));
  });
  console.log("Finished");
})();
```

Much better, and it's work

```
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/1/...
Pokemon: bulbasaur with id: 1
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/2/...
Pokemon: ivysaur with id: 2
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/3/...
Pokemon: venusaur with id: 3
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/4/...
Pokemon: charmander with id: 4
Get pokemon from https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/5/...
Pokemon: charmeleon with id: 5
Finished
```

## We Need Typescript, it's 2023

Oh you need the typescript version??, here we go

```typescript
const asyncForEach = async <T>(
  array: T[],
  callback: (item: T, index: number, array: T[]) => Promise<void>
) => {
  for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
    await callback(array[index], index, array);
  }
};
```
