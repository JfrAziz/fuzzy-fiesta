Sometimes, we don't need any fancy database, like Postgre, MySQL, and the like. What we need is just a simple Google Sheets. Let's create a simple form, and submit it to Google Sheets, without any backend or any bloated js library ðŸ˜‰.

## Cooking your database

First, create a new blank Google Spreadsheets. Don't forget to keep your spreadsheet id, look at the search bar, you can find it from there.

```
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/[spreadsheet_id]/edit#gid=0
```

![Blank Spreadsheet](@assets/images/2023-09-03/1-blank-spreadsheet.png)

Now open `Extensions` `App Script`, and paste the following code to the editor, don't forget to change the `spreadsheet_id`

```js
const spreadSheetId = "some-id"; // your spreadsheet_id
const sheetName = "response"; // sheet name
const lockTime = 100; //ms

function doPost(e) {
  /**
   * lock the spreadsheet
   *
   * @reference https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/lock/lock-service
   * */
  const lock = LockService.getScriptLock();
  lock.tryLock(lockTime);

  try {
    const doc = SpreadsheetApp.openById(spreadSheetId);
    const sheet = doc.getSheetByName(sheetName);

    /**
     * we get all headers value from `response` sheets,
     * header must be in the first row and first column
     * */
    const headers = sheet
      .getRange(1, 1, 1, sheet.getLastColumn())
      .getValues()[0];
    const nextRow = sheet.getLastRow() + 1;

    /**
     * create a new row form the data we send to the form,
     * but for some data, we want define it manually,
     * like no and date.
     *
     * add your own case, if you want something new
     * */
    const newRow = headers.map(function (header) {
      switch (header) {
        case "no":
          return nextRow - 1;
        case "date":
          return new Date();
        default:
          return e.parameter[header];
      }
    });

    /**
     * insert the data to last row
     * */
    sheet.getRange(nextRow, 1, 1, newRow.length).setValues([newRow]);

    /**
     * return back the response to user
     * */
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(
      JSON.stringify({ result: "success", row: nextRow })
    ).setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
  } catch (e) {
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(
      JSON.stringify({ result: "error", error: e })
    ).setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
  } finally {
    lock.releaseLock();
  }
}
```

> always naming your function `doPost`, to handle POST method to your form, and don't forget to save your code

We will use the first row from `response` sheets to define our form keys/columns:

![Spreadsheet Header](@assets/images/2023-09-03/2-header-row.png)

In this case, your keys are `name`, `email`, and `question`. be carefull, because this keys are case-sensitive.

## Preparing the "backend"

Back to the App Script, to get url to submit the form, we need to create a new deployment. `Deploy` `New Deployment`. Select `Web App` as Deployment Type and fill:

- Execute As `Me`
- Who has access `Anyone` (Everyone can submit the form)

![Deploy Script](@assets/images/2023-09-03/3-deploy-script.png)

`Deploy` and now you get the Web App URL. keep it, we will use this URL to submit our form later.

> If you update your script, try to redeploy again.

## Cooking Our form

This method is not limited in HTML Form, you can do this in your backend or just make a simple POST request to your script URL. But, for this tutorial, we create it in simple form. Let's create it with plain html and vanilla js ðŸ˜‰.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Submit Form</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form id="form">
      <div>
        <label for="name">name</label>
        <input type="text" name="name" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="email">email</label>
        <input type="email" name="email" />
      </div>
      <div>
        <label for="question">question</label>
        <textarea name="question"></textarea>
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
    <script>
      /**
       * we capture the form, and send it again
       * with fetch API.
       **/
      const form = document.getElementById("form");

      form.addEventListener("submit", function (event) {
        event.preventDefault();

        const data = new FormData(event.target);

        /**
         * with this you can perform some validation, etc
         **/
        const name = data.get("name");
        const email = data.get("email");

        /**
         * send data to web APP URL from
         * script deployment
         *
         * change the url to your URL, don't use this
         **/
        fetch(
          "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbw_jnqkYazOLr7ZExiD_IlgelGnICroO3yseuuW9jruJk0LAYZSK6JtxfDAhT_eta-f/exec",
          {
            redirect: "follow", // don't remove this
            method: "POST",
            body: data,
          }
        )
          .then(res => res.json())
          .then(data => console.log(data))
          .catch(err => console.log(err));
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Submit, and now you can see the data is coming in your spreadsheets.

## Wrapping Up

This example just simple explanation how this thing works, you can do more than that. Sometimes what we need is just a simple form in our existing app, for example email subscription form, simple survey, etc.

If you need more advance usage of Google Sheets as database, I recommend you to use Google Spreadsheet API. We will talk about it later.
