Let's get straight to the point! Imagine you have an object like this in TypeScript:

```typescript
export const charts = {
  bar: BarChart,
  pie: PieChart,
  radar: RadarChart,
  line: LineChart,
  bump: BumpChart,
  areabump: AreaBumpChart,f charts components!, so I can access itâ€™s contents dy
  radialbar: RadialBarChart,
  heatmap: HeatMapChart,
}
```

Now, you want to create a type based on the keys of this object, and here's how I do it:

```typescript
export type ChartType = keyof typeof charts
              //^? type ChartType = "bar" | "pie" | "radar" | "line" | "bump" | "areabump" | "radialbar" | "heatmap"
```

But here's the catch: this method won't work if you define your object with a type annotation, like so:

```typescript
export const charts: Record<string, Chart> = {
  bar: BarChart,
  pie: PieChart,
  radar: RadarChart,
  line: LineChart,
  bump: BumpChart,
  areabump: AreaBumpChart,
  radialbar: RadialBarChart,
  heatmap: HeatMapChart,
}

export type ChartType = keyof typeof charts
              //^? type ChartType = string
```

## Why I am doing this?? ðŸ¤”

I want to create an object that's like a grand register of charts components!, so I can access it's contents dynamically simply by using 

```typescript
const type = "bar"

const YourDynamicChart = charts[type]
```

I need to create a type for the `type` variable. And that's where the ChartType comes into play! It ensures that the type variable only holds valid chart types
