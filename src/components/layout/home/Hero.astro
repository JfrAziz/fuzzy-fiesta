      Welcome to my website! I am a web developer with a passion for creating
      websites and services. I am using a variety of tools in PHP, Node
      (Typescript), or Java (Kotlin), such as React/Next.js, Laravel, Spring
      Boot, and Express.js, to create websites or REST APIs. I have a deep
      interest in Linux and Docker stuff. Sometimes, I do scripting with Python,
      Node.js, or Bash to automate my works.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not expert, but I know a little bit about statistics, data science,
      and data scraping with R and Python. Currently, I am working as Software
      Engineer at <strong>Statistics Indonesia</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to share my knowledge and experiences through this website. You can
      also follow me on <SocialLinks />
