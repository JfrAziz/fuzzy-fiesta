    "I am a web developer with a passion for creating websites and services. I am using a variety of tools in PHP, Node (Typescript), or Java (Kotlin), such as React/Next.js, Laravel, Spring Boot, and Express.js, to create websites or REST APIs. I have a deep interest in Linux and Docker stuff. Sometimes, I do scripting with Python, Node.js, or Bash to automate my works.",
